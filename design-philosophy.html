              <br>

  			    </div><!-- .post-header -->

  				<div>

    					<p>Design is something that extends beyond any one discipline. Although my Human-Computer Interaction course has forced me to closely examine the design process the most closely, I’ve found that it can be applied to almost any creative pursuit.</p>
              <p>As someone who’s spent nearly their whole life creating in one sense or another, I’ve come up with my own, messy version of a design process without even really meaning to. I’d wait for inspiration to strike, cram in as much research as possible before I got bored, and then spend days working tirelessly on whatever wacky project I’d chosen for myself. While that certainly was fun, this semester has taught me to channel that creative energy into a process that is refined, meticulous, and extremely powerful.</p>

              <h3><strong>The Importance of Understanding the Problem</strong></h3>
              <p>For myself and many self-described “makers,” the passion lies more so in the act of creating an artifact than any particular useful function that artifact may perform. In engineering and design, however, the opposite is required. Design seeks to solve a problem. The problem can be as small, uncomplicated, or inconsequential as you like, but the first step to good design is always understanding <em>what the problem actually is.</em></p>
              <p>According to <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/sendhil_mullainathan">Sendhil Mullainathan</a>, most problems can’t actually be solved. The conditions they create can be improved, or coping with them can be made easier, but the source of the issue is often something that can’t be changed. Despite this, it still pays to identify the source of the problem. From there, a designer can think laterally and identify many potential solutions and eventually settle on one that they think they can implement.</p>
              <p>I got to see how effective this process was from day one of the semester. We started the course with an exercise in which we interviewed our peers about their least favorite parts of the airport experience. The person I interviewed had a totally different perspective on airports than I did, so I really needed to listen to what they had to say about their air travel troubles.</p>


            <div class="figure">
            <div><img src="images/image_1.jfif" /></div>

            <p class="caption">Each person’s experience of why airports are terrible is completely unique, so it’s important to interview multiple potential users.</p>
          </div>

            <p>From there, I was able to identify the problems my interviewee was having and start brainstorming potential solutions to their issues. This sort of lateral thinking makes all the difference, and has proven to be useful not only in computer interface design, but also in my senior design seminar and even the sculpture class I’m taking. Your first idea is usually not your best, and so it’s important to take the ideation process seriously and make sure you’re on the right track before you go too far down the wrong one.</p>

            <h3><strong>Understanding Your Users</strong></h3>

            <p>Andrew J. Ko states in his article “<a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/design-methods/how-to-understand-problems.html" >How to Understand Problems</a>” that “there is no such thing as the average user. Every single solution will meet some people’s needs while failing to meet others.” This is something that is crucial to keep in mind when designing for a broad audience. It is impossible to tailor a design such that each individual user will have an optimal experience. Our only form of recourse against this is to research the user base extensively. Ask them what they need, and then observe them to see if they’re correct. Consider as many types of people as possible, and consult representatives from those groups. Only then can we approximate a general set of most common needs, and then design to those.</p>

            <p>I found this tenet to be crucial to our <a href="https://medium.com/@mvp005/an-affectiva-application-to-help-your-attention-span-136cbe615c0f">Design for Wellbeing</a> challenge. After the brainstorming process, my group decided to pursue making an Affectiva application that would help people stay focused while doing work on the computer. To make sure that this idea would actually be helpful, as well as get a sense of what features would be most important, we interviewed some of our peers to find out how students like to be productive.</p>

            <div class="figure">
            <div><img src="images/image_2.png" /></div>
            <p class="caption">We asked our users some of the above questions to get a sense of how they do their work.</p>
            </div>

            <p>We ultimately got a huge variety of responses. We found that some people preferred to work on a computer, but would often get distracted by social media sites. Others tried to avoid using a computer altogether due to potential distractions. From these responses, we realized that our application would not be able to help everyone stay productive, but only could aid a portion of the population. It’s important to note that narrowing the scope of a design is not a bad thing; in fact, it’s better to be honest about what your product can reasonably be expected to do and who it can actually help.</p>

            <h3>Know (And Plan For) What’s Actually Possible</h3>
            <p>Doing short design sprints like the ones we did in HCI was a challenge unlike those I’d previously experienced. We were exposed to new technologies and then expected to develop applications, games, and interfaces with them in only about two weeks. While most design in the world of industry involves a more forgiving expertise/time balance, it’s still something that a designer has to account for.</p>
            <p>This issue was particularly present during the <a href="https://medium.com/@mvp005/design-for-another-world-fear-of-heights-4d0c74a34e58" >Design for Another World </a>sprint. Our brainstorming process was a great deal of fun, but we kept feeling ourselves pushing up against the bounds of what could be done with our level of expertise, technology, and time limitations. We considered making games, but didn’t feel we had enough input options at our disposal. We thought about making a short film, but didn’t feel we had the experience to really polish the final product. Although we did settle on doing something like the latter, I think it would have served us well to think harder and do more research on what sorts of methods were the most feasible.</p>

            <div class="figure">
            <div><img src="images/image_3.gif" /></div>
            <p class="caption">I spent hours modeling this lovely 3D bridge animation…. that we couldn’t use.</p>
            </div>

            <p>And while it’s important to push yourself as a designer, it’s nice to have something to show for all your work. Understanding technical limitations <em>before</em> you start work on a project could make all the difference down the line.</p>

            <div class="figure">
            <div><img src="images/image_4.gif" /></div>
            <p class="caption">This would have looked a lot cooler with a more realistic bridge.</p>
            </div>


            <h3>Iteration and Prototyping</h3>
            <p>Once you’ve done your brainstorming/ideation and defined the bounds of what’s possible within the scope of your project, it’s time to actually start doing it.</p>
            <p>With design sprints as short as the ones we did this semester, it was difficult to find the right balance between thinking and doing. However, I know from other experiences in both art and engineering that experimentation is key. The only way to know for sure if something is going to work is to try it. Andrew Ko’s <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/design-methods/how-to-prototype.html" >How to Prototype</a> details the importance of this process.</p>

            <div class="figure">
            <div><img src="images/image_5.jpeg" /></div>
            <p class="caption">A paper prototype from the Design for Others sprint.</p>
            </div>

            <p>The Design for Others design challenge really forced us to utilize the paper prototyping process. Since this was our first sprint, we found out early on how helpful this step is in getting quick user feedback as well as communicating ideas within a group.</p>
            <p>During the Design for Fun sprint, we spent a good chunk of our time just playing around with the different apps that the LEAP SDK had to offer. This allowed us to understand how the technology worked. We then jumped in to writing some simple code that allowed us to control some basic computer functions with the LEAP Motion interface.</p>

            <div class="figure">
            <div><img src="images/image_6.png" /></div>
            <p class="caption">The LEAP Motion API Documentation was extremely helpful in allowing us to whip up some test code.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Before long, we’d used example snippets and some basic info from the LEAP Documentation to make a basic program. This step was so helpful in allowing us to work out any kinks with the technology early on and avoid any fatal demo day issues.</p>
            <p>If this were a longer-term project, we would have wanted to take the feedback we received on our demo and iterate again in order to further improve our design.</p>

            <div class="figure">
            <div><img src="images/image_7.png" /></div>
            <p class="caption">We did get to do a little bit of user testing on our final product just before the demo day.</p>
            </div>

            <p>No matter how great you feel your final product is, there are always improvements that could be made, and types of people that your design will under serve. Iteration is an important part of the process that allows for a highly refined finished design.</p>
            <h3>Passion and Personal Investment</h3>
            <p><em>Really</em> good design shouldn’t just be cool or interesting or technologically impressive — it should be <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">meaningful</em>. The things that have inspired me throughout my life have been things into which the creator has poured their heart, things they really believed in. This isn’t to say that design can’t be good if it isn’t something the designer was passionate about. But that extra bit of love and care often really shows through in the work.</p>
            <p>There are a plethora of examples of people coming up with technical solutions to problems that affect them personally. People with disabilities come up with brilliant solutions to accessibility problems. Women invent devices to help with personal safety or health. A parent’s child falls ill with a rare disease —<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/martine_rothblatt_my_daughter_my_wife_our_robot_and_the_quest_for_immortality"> so she finds the cure</a>. An engineer has the unique power to spot issues in society that they feel are under served and personally set out to solve them. When engineers practice compassion, that compassion bleeds into their works.</p>
            <p>Many of us like to pretend that engineering is a cold, calculating, systematizing profession. But as technology becomes more and more prolific, it’s becoming more obvious than ever that <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUvmqKvZQ-0">we need compassionate technology</a>.</p>
            <p>We as engineers have control over things that impact countless lives, so we need to take the time to ensure that we love, care about and believe in what we’re working on.</p>

            <div class="figure">
            <div><img src="images/conflict.jpeg" /></div>
            <p class="caption">Technology has the power to change society.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Racial tensions in the United States is something that I personally am passionate about, and so when we were asked to create a chatbot to engage a serious issue, I wanted to try to take on this massive challenge. While we didn’t really have the time or the resources to create something world-changing, it was really gratifying to actually take on a real world issue.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Over the past semester, I’ve learned so much about what good design actually means. These five major design components I’ve outlined above are things that I truly believe will not only make for good design, but also design that is useful, enjoyable, and meaningful to those who interact with it.</p>
